<a name="welcome-to-plain-game" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-plain-game"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to PLAIN game</h3>

<p>Argos,the brilliant Golden Retreiver with fluffy ears, has been lost in the city of Thessaloniki.</p>

<p>Help Phoebus and Artemis find him!</p>

<ul>
<li>Plan effective search strategies to find Argos</li>
<li>Solve the puzzles which lead to the monuments where Argos is hiding</li>
<li>Visit the most iconic monuments of Thessaloniki following the clues provided by the characters in the game</li>
<li>Discover the keywords contained in labels hidden in each (real life) monument</li>
<li>Enter the keywords in the PLAIN app and receive instructions how to go find Argos!</li>
<li>Visit Argos's hiding place, register your name in the hall of fame and claim your gift!<br>
The choices made by the children with respect to the easiest riddles (search strategy choices) are being recorded, so that they can be later evaluated by scientists specialising in special educational needs (provided the children's parents agree to anonymously release the data for such this purpose).The innovation of the app lies with the massive online gathering of such data, in order to help improve pattern recognition and statistical inference algorithms that can advise parents and educators to seek additional specialised support for children with special educational needs.</li>
</ul><p>PLAIN stands for Play, Learn, Assess, INclude. It is a series of software applications, books and stories which aim to promote inclusion of children with special educational needs in team games along with other children and adults, in order to learn through entertainment. Team PLAIN came together for the first time in order to participate in the Apps4Thessaloniki competition, however we plan to carry on developing the PLAIN series afterwards as well.</p>

<a name="specs" class="anchor" href="#specs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Specs</h3>

<p>This is a native Android application, compatible with mobile phones and tablets running Android version 4.0 or newer. It will also run in Android versions as early as 2.3, however the settings in the main menu may not work. This application offers entertainment, education, team participation and also records the search strategy choices made by children users. Particular attention is paid to choices made by children with special education requirements, the data from which may be shared with scientists specialising in this field. Transfer of such data is anonymous and subject to consent provided by the children's parents or guardians. Such large scale data gathering is needed in order to help support further development and improvement of biomedical engineering research, specifically pattern recognition, early warning and education support algorithms for children with special education requirements.</p>

<a name="plain-team" class="anchor" href="#plain-team"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PLAIN Team</h3>

<p>This application was developed without funding by members of the Medical Physical laboratory of the Medical Dept. and the School of Fine Arts of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the Computer Science Dept and Makers Society of the American College of Thessaloniki, as well as the charity NGO INCLUDE.The team consist of 6 members and it is getting bigger. At the moment the members are:<br>
1. <strong>Dr. Alexandros Astaras</strong> - Physicist, Engineer, Biomedical Engineer<br>
2. <strong>Dr. Andromachi Nanou</strong> - Special Education Teacher, Pedagogue (President of Non Governmental Organisation <a href="http://include-edu.blogspot.gr/">INCLUDE</a>)<br>
3. <strong>Apostolos Siokas</strong> - Computer Scientist (<a href="https://github.com/solotsopa" class="user-mention">@solotsopa</a>)<br>
4. <strong>Alkistis Karouli</strong> - Designer, Artist<br>
5. <strong>Julia Sason</strong> - Special Education Teacher<br>
6. <strong>Spyros Mavroforos</strong> - Programmer<br></p>

<h3>
<a name="design-and-code" class="anchor" href="#design-and-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design and Code</h3>

<p>All together worked as team in order to produce this special game. The drawings are all painted by Alkistis Karouli and the code is written by Apostolos Siokas.</p>

<h3>
<a name="expectations" class="anchor" href="#expectations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Expectations</h3>

<p>We focuses on the children with special education requirements and we expect that our game will increase the education level of the children, easier and with more fun than the normal way. We are going to produce games like that for more cities in order for more children to be able to play PLAIN game. </p>
