<p>This is a native Android application, compatible with mobile phones and tablets running Android version 4.0 or newer. It will also run in Android versions as early as 2.3, however the settings in the main menu may not work.</p>

<p>This application offers entertainment, education, team participation and also records the search strategy choices made by children users. Particular attention is paid to choices made by children with special education requirements, the data from which may be shared with scientists specialising in this field. Transfer of such data is anonymous and subject to consent provided by the children's parents or guardians. Such large scale data gathering is needed in order to help support further development and improvement of biomedical engineering research, specifically pattern recognition, early warning and education support algorithms for children with special education requirements.</p>
